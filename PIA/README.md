## PIA Construction Projects Calculator

This program helps an architect or builder to know how much material and money will be spent on making a project. Helping processes to be faster.

The program has a menu of options with all the projects that can be calculated. The 4 projects that can be calculated are: Install Floor, Painting walls, waterproof a roof, concrete slab.

The program is mainly made up of switch, printf, scanf, while, operators, float variables and many formulas that I got from an extensive research.
